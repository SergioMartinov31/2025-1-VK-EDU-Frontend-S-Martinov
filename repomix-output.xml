This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.

<file_summary>
This section contains a summary of this file.

<purpose>
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

<notes>
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# Цель
Сделать простой в установки и использовании мессенджер для рабочих групп. Образцовая реализация: Slack. Использование предполагается в закрытых коллективах, поэтому вопросы сообщества (заявки в друзья, спам, некорректное поведение, модерация, блокирование пользователей) не стоят.

# Основные сущности

## Пользователи
Пользователи авторизуются (идентифицируют себя) с помощью любой соц. сети. Пользователи должны дополнительно указать свое ФИО и никнейм, который по-умолчанию получается транслитерацией ФИО. Никнейм пользователя должен быть уникален. Пользователи не обладают никакими отношениями (дружба, following) за исключением участия в общих чатах.

## Чаты
Чат - это место общения 2 и более пользователей. Чаты могут быть персональные (2 участника), а могут быть групповыми. В групповых чатах администратора нет. Единственный способ попасть в чат - быть добавленным другим участником чата. У группового чата так же как и у пользователя может быть название и никнейм. Никнейм чата должен быть уникален.

## Сообщения
Пользователи, участвующие в чате могу отправлять не сообщения - произвольный текст до размером до 4Кб. Сообщения могут содержать простую markdown-like разметку, например @somenick - ссылка на пользователя и т.п.

## Файлы
Пользователи могут загружать файлы на сервер и отправлять ссылку на них в чат. При этом файлы становятся связаны с пользователем, который их загрузил и с чатом.

# Основные сценарии

## Вход в систему
Пользователю предлагается авторизоваться с использованием любой соц. Сети. Если это первый вход пользователь должен заполнить свои ФИО и никнейм. После этого пользователь попадает на основной экран мессенджера.

## Поиск пользователей
Поскольку у пользователей нет постоянных списков контактов, поиск осуществляется по всей базе пользователей проекта. Поиск происходит по ФИО и никнейму пользователя.

## Поиск чатов
Осуществляется по всем чатам, в которых принимал участие текущий пользователь. Поиск происходит по названию и никнейму чата. Первыми отображаются те чаты, в которых было последнее сообщение.

## Получение списка чатов пользователя
Пользователь получает только те чаты, участником которых он является. Сортировка: по дате последнего сообщения.

## Создание персонального чата
Создание персонального чата происходит автоматически при клике на любого пользователя, если чат до этого не был создан. Из персонального чата нельзя выйти.

## Создание группового чата
Создание группового чата происходит нажатием кнопки “создать групповой чат”. Сразу после создания в чате присутствует только его создатель. Создателю предлагается задать название и никнейм нового чата и добавить участников.

## Добавление участников в групповой чат
Любой из участников чата может добавить дополнительных пользователей в чат. При этом в чат будет должно быть отправлено сервисное сообщение. У добавленного пользователя чат появится в списке чатов в самом верху, будет отмечен непрочитанным.

## Выход из группового чата
Любой из участников чата может в любой момент покинуть чат нажатием кнопки “покинуть чат”. При этом он исчезает из списка участников, чат исчезает из списка его чатов (и не может быть более “найден”), а в чат отправляется сервисное сообщение. Когда последний участник покинул групповой чат, чат удаляется.

## Отправка сообщения в чат
Любой участник чата может отправить в него сообщение. Это сообщение будет добавлено в историю чата и отправлено всем его участникам.

## Прочтение сообщения
Если сообщение оказывается видимым пользователю (пользователь просматривает чат в данный момент), то сообщение считается прочитанным, иначе для данного пользователя увеличится счетчик непрочитанных сообщений в чате.

## Загрузка файла
Пользователь, находясь на странице чата загружает файл на сервер. Файл помечается принадлежащим текущему пользователю и текущему чату. В чат отправляется сервисное сообщение с ссылкой на скачивание файла.


# Минимальный функционал
В для сдачи проекта (на удовл.) необходимо реализовать авторизацию, поиск пользователей, и персональные чаты.
Групповые загрузка файлов и групповые чаты - функционал на хор. И отл.
